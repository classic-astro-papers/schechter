An Analytic Expression for the Luminosity Function for Galaxies
---------------------------------------------------------------

As an exercise in experimental reproducibility, we examine the results of
Schechter (1976) - full article [here](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1976ApJ...203..297S&link_type=ARTICLE&db_key=AST&high=) - with modern data and data analysis
techniques. We make our analysis and results available for pedagogical and
research purposes by providing this code repository. It contains all the
scripts used in the analysis and a master script (`run_expt.py`) that
automatically pulls all of the data used and processes it, outputting the very
same results we publish. The description of our analysis, along with these
results are found in the "documents" directory, as is an instructional
document with directions on how to use or customise this software.

It is our hope that our efforts will aid in encouraging our colleagues in the
astronomy community to make their discoveries publicly available in this
manner and make their methods fully transparent and automatically reproducible.
